Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection from a previous attempt.\n\n**Context:**\n- The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. \n- The reflection is generated using ground truth answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user to create predictions that likely align with ground truth. \n\n**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only. Do not use markdown formatting or code blocks.**\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt\n- Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies, or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook\n- Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook\n- Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed\n- Focus on quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one\n- Format your response as a PURE JSON object with specific sections\n- For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field\n- Be concise and specific - each addition should be actionable\n\n\n**Training Context:**\n- Total token budget: 80000 tokens\n- Training progress: Sample 1 out of 1\n\n**Current Playbook Stats:**\n{\n  \"total_bullets\": 0,\n  \"high_performing\": 0,\n  \"problematic\": 0,\n  \"unused\": 0,\n  \"by_section\": {}\n}\n\n**Recent Reflection:**\n<think>\n</think>{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model correctly identified that the current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a reflection where the model correctly calculated the current ratio. The key insight from the reflection is that the model applied the formula directly without errors. The current playbook sections include FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS, so I need to add a new bullet there.\n\nThe existing playbook's formulas section might not have the current ratio formula. The reflection mentions the formula is current assets divided by current liabilities. So, adding that formula as a bullet under FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS makes sense. Also, the reflection's key insight emphasizes consistent units, so including a note about checking units before calculations would be helpful. That's a new strategy not covered yet. So, two operations: add the formula and add the unit consistency tip. But wait, the user said to avoid redundancy. Let me check if the existing playbook has these. Since the current stats show total_bullets is 0, maybe the playbook is empty. So adding both the formula and the unit check would be new. But the reflection's key insight is about consistent units, so that's a new strategy. Therefore, two operations: one for the formula and another for the unit check. But the user's example response only had one operation. Wait, the reflection's key insight is about applying the formula directly and ensuring consistent units. So the formula is one bullet, and the unit check is another. But the user's instruction says to add only new content. So I need to create two ADD operations. But the example in the response only has one. Hmm. Let me check the available operations again. The available operations are ADD, so each new bullet is an ADD. So, for the formula and the unit check, two separate bullets. So the operations array would have two entries. But the user's example in the reflection has a single bullet. Wait, the reflection's key insight is that the model applied the formula directly and ensured consistent units. So the two new bullets would be the formula and the unit check. Therefore, two operations. But the user's instruction says to avoid redundancy. Since the current playbook has zero bullets, adding both is okay. So the JSON should have two ADD operations. Let me structure that.\n</think>{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The reflection confirms the model correctly applied the current ratio formula (current assets / current liabilities) and maintained unit consistency. The playbook lacks explicit documentation of this formula and the unit consistency check, which are critical for accurate financial calculations.
