Find the current ratio. Your answer should be a plain floating point number, round to the nearest hundredth if necessary. Do the necessary conversions, for example 5 million should be 5000000.0. \n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the current ratio of a software development firm. They provided current assets at $1,000,000 and current liabilities at $500,000. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the current ratio is. From the playbook, the formula for the current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. That's straightforward. So I should take the assets, which are $1,000,000, and divide by the liabilities, $500,000.\n\nWait, the problem mentions converting numbers like 5 million to 5000000.0. Here, the numbers are already in thousands, but maybe they need to be in the same format. Let me check the numbers again. The assets are $1,000,000, which is 1 million. The liabilities are $500,000, which is half a million. So converting them to the same unit, they are already in the correct format as numbers. \n\nSo the calculation would be 1,000,000 divided by 500,000. Let me do that. 1,000,000 divided by 500,000 equals 2.0. Since the question says to round to the nearest hundredth if necessary, but in this case, it's a whole number. So the answer is 2.0.\n\nNow, checking the common mistakes. The playbook might have a mistake about not converting units properly. But here, the numbers are already in the same units, so no conversion needed. Also, ensuring that the formula is applied correctly. The current ratio is assets over liabilities, not the other way around. So that's correct here.\n\nThe relevant bullet points would be the formula for current ratio (calc-00001) and financial calculations (fin-00002). So the bullet_ids should include those. The final answer is 2.0.\n</think>{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Given current assets of $1,000,000 and current liabilities of $500,000, the calculation is 1,000,000 / 500,000 = 2.0. No unit conversion is needed as the values are already in consistent units.
