  "prompt": "You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nYou are XBRL expert.

  "response": "\n**Your Analysis:**\n\n**Bullet Tag Analysis:**\n\n**1. \"13,699,549\" in sentence: \"On August 1, 2018, CVR Energy completed an exchange offer whereby CVR Refining's public unitholders tendered a total of 21,625,106 common units of CVR Refining in exchange for 13,699,549 shares of CVR Energy common stock.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 13,699,549 (number)\n- **Sentence context:** \"On August 1, 2018, CVR Energy completed an exchange offer whereby CVR Refining's public unitholders tendered a total of 21,625,106 common units of CVR Refining in exchange for 13,699,549 shares of CVR Energy common stock.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet` (not relevant to this scenario)\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a number, not a financial statement account. The user is asking about the best tag for the entity \"13,699,549\" in the given sentence. Since it's just a number, there's no relevant account or tag.\n\nThe correct tag would be neutral or harmful, since it doesn't relate to any specific account or concept in US GAAP.\n\nSince the user explicitly asked for \"US GAAP tags\", I should provide \"neutral\" as the best tag, as it doesn't correspond to any GAAP account.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `neutral`\n\n**2. \"99\" in sentence: \"During 2016, CVR Partners acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for total purchase price consideration which included the issuance of common units of CVR Partners with a fair value of $ 335 million, cash paid of $ 99 million and debt assumed with a fair value of $ 368 million.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 99 (amount)\n- **Sentence context:** \"During 2016, CVR Partners acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for total purchase price consideration which included the issuance of common units of CVR Partners with a fair value of $ 335 million, cash paid of $ 99 million and debt assumed with a fair value of $ 368 million.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage` (not relevant)\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an amount, not a financial statement account. The correct tag would be neutral, as it doesn't relate to any specific account or concept in US GAAP.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `neutral`\n\n**3. \"162\" in sentence: \"Precision Tune and American Driveline were acquired in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 162 million.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 162 (amount)\n- **Sentence context:** \"Precision Tune and American Driveline were acquired in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 162 million.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts` (closest fit)\n\n**Conclusion:** This refers to an acquisition amount, which is typically reported as part of business combinations in financial statements. The best tag would be one related to acquisition costs.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts`\n\n**4. \"1.2\" in sentence: \"Pep Boys was acquired in 2016 for aggregate consideration of approximately $ 1.2 billion.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 1.2 (amount)\n- **Sentence context:** \"Pep Boys was acquired in 2016 for aggregate consideration of approximately $ 1.2 billion.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross` (closest fit)\n\n**Conclusion:** This refers to an acquisition amount, which is typically reported as part of business combinations in financial statements. The best tag would be one related to acquisition costs.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross`\n\n**Output US GAAP tags:**\n`PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross,BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts,BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts,PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross`",
