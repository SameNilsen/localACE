  "prompt": "You are a master curator of knowledge. Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection from a previous attempt.\n\n**Context:**\n- The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. \n- The reflection is generated using ground truth answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user to create predictions that likely align with ground truth. \n\n**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only. Do not use markdown formatting or code blocks.**\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt\n- Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies, or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook\n- Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook\n- Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed\n- Focus on quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one\n- Format your response as a PURE JSON object with specific sections\n- For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field\n- Be concise and specific - each addition should be actionable\n\n\n**Training Context:**\n- Total token budget: 80000 tokens\n- Training progress: Sample 1 out of 1\n\n**Current Playbook Stats:**\n{\n  \"total_bullets\": 0,\n  \"high_performing\": 0,\n  \"problematic\": 0,\n  \"unused\": 0,\n  \"by_section\": {}\n}\n\n**Recent Reflection:**\n\n**Your Analysis:**\n\n**Bullet Tag Analysis:**\n\n**1. \"13,699,549\" in sentence: \"On August 1, 2018, CVR Energy completed an exchange offer whereby CVR Refining's public unitholders tendered a total of 21,625,106 common units of CVR Refining in exchange for 13,699,549 shares of CVR Energy common stock.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 13,699,549 (number)\n- **Sentence context:** \"On August 1, 2018, CVR Energy completed an exchange offer whereby CVR Refining's public unitholders tendered a total of 21,625,106 common units of CVR Refining in exchange for 13,699,549 shares of CVR Energy common stock.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `OperatingLeasesRentExpenseNet` (not relevant to this scenario)\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a number, not a financial statement account. The user is asking about the best tag for the entity \"13,699,549\" in the given sentence. Since it's just a number, there's no relevant account or tag.\n\nThe correct tag would be neutral or harmful, since it doesn't relate to any specific account or concept in US GAAP.\n\nSince the user explicitly asked for \"US GAAP tags\", I should provide \"neutral\" as the best tag, as it doesn't correspond to any GAAP account.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `neutral`\n\n**2. \"99\" in sentence: \"During 2016, CVR Partners acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for total purchase price consideration which included the issuance of common units of CVR Partners with a fair value of $ 335 million, cash paid of $ 99 million and debt assumed with a fair value of $ 368 million.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 99 (amount)\n- **Sentence context:** \"During 2016, CVR Partners acquired a nitrogen fertilizer business for total purchase price consideration which included the issuance of common units of CVR Partners with a fair value of $ 335 million, cash paid of $ 99 million and debt assumed with a fair value of $ 368 million.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage` (not relevant)\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an amount, not a financial statement account. The correct tag would be neutral, as it doesn't relate to any specific account or concept in US GAAP.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `neutral`\n\n**3. \"162\" in sentence: \"Precision Tune and American Driveline were acquired in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 162 million.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 162 (amount)\n- **Sentence context:** \"Precision Tune and American Driveline were acquired in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 162 million.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts` (closest fit)\n\n**Conclusion:** This refers to an acquisition amount, which is typically reported as part of business combinations in financial statements. The best tag would be one related to acquisition costs.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts`\n\n**4. \"1.2\" in sentence: \"Pep Boys was acquired in 2016 for aggregate consideration of approximately $ 1.2 billion.?\"**\n\n- **Entity:** 1.2 (amount)\n- **Sentence context:** \"Pep Boys was acquired in 2016 for aggregate consideration of approximately $ 1.2 billion.\"\n\n- **Tag:** `PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross` (closest fit)\n\n**Conclusion:** This refers to an acquisition amount, which is typically reported as part of business combinations in financial statements. The best tag would be one related to acquisition costs.\n\nLet me structure the response clearly with the tag and comma separation. **Best Tag:** `PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross`\n\n**Output US GAAP tags:**\n`PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross,BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts,BusinessCombinationAcquisitionRelatedCosts,PaymentsToAcquireBusinessesGross`\n\n**Current Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n\n**Question Context:**\n\n\n**Your Task:**\nOutput ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- operations: a list of operations to be performed on the playbook\n  - type: the type of operation to be performed\n  - section: the section to add the bullet to\n  - content: the new content of the bullet\n\n**Available Operations:**\n1.

The user provided four entities to tag:\n   - 13,699,549 (number)\n   - 99 (amount)\n   - 162 (amount)\n   - 1.2 (amount)\n\n2.
