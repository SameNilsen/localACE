  "prompt": "You are an analysis expert tasked with answering questions using your knowledge, a curated playbook of strategies and insights and a reflection that goes over the diagnosis of all previous mistakes made while answering the question.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Read the playbook carefully and apply relevant strategies, formulas, and insights\n- Pay attention to common mistakes listed in the playbook and avoid them\n- Show your reasoning step-by-step\n- Be concise but thorough in your analysis\n- If the playbook contains relevant code snippets or formulas, use them appropriately\n- Double-check your calculations and logic before providing the final answer\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields:\n- reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n- bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that's relevant, helpful for you to answer this question, you should include their bullet_id in this list\n- final_answer: your concise final answer\n\n\n**Playbook:**\n## STRATEGIES & INSIGHTS\n\n## FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS\n\n## CODE SNIPPETS & TEMPLATES\n\n## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS\n\n## CONTEXT CLUES & INDICATORS\n\n## OTHERS\n\n**Reflection:**\n(empty)\n\n**Question:**\nA software development firm lists its current assets at $1,000,000 and its current liabilities at $500,000. Find the current ratio. Your answer should be a plain floating point number, round to the nearest hundredth if necessary. Do the necessary conversions, for example 5 million should be 5000000.0. \n\n**Context:**\n\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",  \n  \"bullet_ids\": [\"calc-00001\", \"fin-00002\"],  \n  \"final_answer\": \"[Your concise final answer here]\"\n}\n\n---\n",

Given:\n   - Assets: $1,000,000\n   - Liabilities: $500,000\n\n2. I need to find the current ratio.\n\n3. Current ratio = Assets / Liabilities\n\n4. So: Current ratio = 1,000,000 / 500,000 = 2.0\n\n5. I should provide:\n   - My reasoning step-by-step\n   - The bullet_ids of relevant playbook points\n   - The final answer as 2.0\n\nLet me structure the response according to the requirements. ",
