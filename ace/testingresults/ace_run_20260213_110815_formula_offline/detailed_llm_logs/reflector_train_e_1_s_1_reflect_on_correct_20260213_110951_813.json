  "prompt": "You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model's reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between predicted answer and the ground truth.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong\n- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap\n- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies\n- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future\n- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors\n- Be specific about what the model should have done differently\n- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.\n- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)\n\nYour output should be a json object, which contains the following fields\n  - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations\n  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?\n  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?\n  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?\n  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?\n  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator\n\n\n\n\n**Question:**\nA software development firm lists its current assets at $1,000,000 and its current liabilities at $500,000. Find the current ratio. Your answer should be a plain floating point number, round to the nearest hundredth if necessary. Do the necessary conversions, for example 5 million should be 5000000.0. \n\n**Model's Reasoning Trace:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"My detailed analysis and calculations\",\n  \"bullet_ids\": [\n    \"fin-00002\"\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": 2.0\n}\n```\n\nLet me break down this question:\n\n1. Given:\n   - Assets: $1,000,000\n   - Liabilities: $500,000\n\n2. I need to find the current ratio.\n\n3. Current ratio = Assets / Liabilities\n\n4. So: Current ratio = 1,000,000 / 500,000 = 2.0\n\n5. I should provide:\n   - My reasoning step-by-step\n   - The bullet_ids of relevant playbook points\n   - The final answer as 2.0\n\nLet me structure the response according to the requirements. \n\n**Model's Predicted Answer:**\n2.0\n\n**Ground Truth Answer:**\n2.0\n\n**Environment Feedback:**\nPredicted answer matches ground truth\n\n**Part of Playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question:**\n(No bullets used by generator)\n\n**Answer in this exact JSON format:**\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations]\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"[What specifically went wrong in the reasoning?]\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"[Why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?]\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"[What should the model have done instead?]\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"[What strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?]\",\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\n    {\"id\": \"calc-00001\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\n    {\"id\": \"fin-00002\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n---\n",
