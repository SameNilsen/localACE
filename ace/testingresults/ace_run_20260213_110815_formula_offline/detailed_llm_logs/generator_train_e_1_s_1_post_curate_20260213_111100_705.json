Question: \"A software development firm lists its current assets at $1,000,000 and its current liabilities at $500,000. Find the current ratio. Your answer should be a plain floating point number, round to the nearest hundredth if necessary.\"\n\n2. Format requirements:\n   - JSON object with \"reasoning\", \"bullet_ids\", and \"final_answer\"\n   - \"final_answer\" should be a plain floating point number, rounded to the nearest hundredth\n\n3. I need to:\n   - Calculate the current ratio\n   - Present my reasoning step-by-step\n   - Provide the final answer as a floating point number\n\nLet me structure my response according to the format requirements.\n\nThe current ratio is calculated as:\nCurrent Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nSo:\n- Current Assets = 1,000,000 USD\n- Current Liabilities = 500,000 USD\n\nCurrent Ratio = 1,000,000 / 500,000 = 2.0\n\nI should:\n1. Present my calculation step-by-step\n2. Provide the final answer as 2.0\n\nLet me write a clear, structured response. ",
