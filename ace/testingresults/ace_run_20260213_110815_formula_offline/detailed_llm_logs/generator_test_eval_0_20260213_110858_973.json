  "response": "\nLet me break down this request:\n\n1. Question: \"For a landscaping business that earned a revenue of $300,000 and an Operating Income of $45,000 last year, find the Operating Margin.\"\n\n2. Format requirements:\n   - Answer should be a plain floating point number, round to the nearest hundredth if necessary.\n   - \"5 million should be 5000000.0.\"\n\n3. Context: Empty\n\n4. I need to:\n   - Calculate the operating margin\n   - Present the answer as a floating point number rounded to the nearest hundredth\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Calculate operating margin: Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue\n   - Operating Income = $45,000\n   - Revenue = $300,000\n\n2. Convert $300,000 to 300000.0 if needed\n3. Convert $45,000 to 45000.0 if needed\n\n4. Calculate: Operating Margin = 45000/300000 ≈ 0.15\n\n5. Round to nearest hundredth: 0.15 = 0.150\n\nSo the final answer should be: 0.150\n\nLet me structure the JSON response:\n\n- \"reasoning\": A brief explanation of the calculation\n- \"bullet_ids\": References to relevant playbook bullet points\n- \"final_answer\": 0.150\n\nLet me write a clear, concise response that follows the format requirements.
